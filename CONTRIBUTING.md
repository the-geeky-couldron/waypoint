# Contributing to Waypoint

Keep real roads, location confidence and guidance readable when changing a game world. Include a focused description, relevant tests and screenshots for visible changes.

## Keep public examples neutral

- Never commit personal GPS traces, search histories, home/work addresses, device identifiers, private account details or unredacted screenshots.
- Use fictional names and synthetic coordinates for regression fixtures. Use fixed public demonstration landmarks when a live map or service is essential.
- Remove status bars, notification content and image metadata from published app captures. Check the visible map and labels too; stripping metadata alone is insufficient.
- Release notes describe the behavior changed, without reproducing a user's place queries, routes or troubleshooting details.
- Keep private QA inputs and captures under ignored local directories. Do not attach them to public issues, workflow artifacts or releases.
- Keep signing keys and tokens out of the repository. Use encrypted repository secrets for release signing.

## Verification

Run the relevant Android unit tests and lint. Validate cartography after map-style edits with `npm ci --prefix tools/style-validation` and `node scripts/validate_styles.cjs`. For changes to editable onboarding motion, run `npm ci --prefix tools/waypoint-motion` and `npm run lint --prefix tools/waypoint-motion`. CI also runs focused Android emulator tests for package security and quest storage. See [the release guide](docs/releasing.md) for the full check tree and signed builds, and [validation notes](docs/validation.md) for the distinction between controlled tests and real-road evidence.

README artwork can be reproduced using [the promotional art generator](scripts/create_readme_promo.py) and local sanitised demonstration captures. Keep source captures, render outputs, logs, APKs and reference imagery out of Git. Run `python3 scripts/check_repo_hygiene.py` before committing; CI runs the same file, media and basic PII/secret-pattern checks. Review examples manually as well: automated checks cannot recognize every personal place or identifier.

## iOS contributions

The iOS port is in progress. Follow the [build guide](ios/README.md) and update the [feature comparison](ios/PARITY.md) when adding Android behaviour. Record test results and remaining device checks in [iOS validation](ios/VALIDATION.md). Keep implementation status separate from behaviour verified on a device.

With a full Xcode installation selected, run `swift test --package-path ios/WaypointKit`. The iOS scheme also contains a native Ferrostar parser test and simulator UI tests. Include their results when they run; leave unexecuted checks marked as such. Use public demonstration locations for screenshots and follow the privacy rules above.

Edit `ios/project.yml` and the staging scripts instead of committing the generated Xcode project or copied assets. UI fonts, artwork and map resources come from the Android tree. Keep signing credentials, provisioning profiles, IPAs and local QA outputs out of the PR.
