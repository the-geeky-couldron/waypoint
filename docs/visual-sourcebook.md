# Map and HUD sourcebook

Research for the user's private Waypoint Android app, 30 October 2026. These sources inform separately authored Compose controls and real-world map styles. Reference screenshots stay in ignored local research folders; they are not packaged as runtime map artwork. Sources show different versions and states, so a pause map, a gameplay radar, a treasure map and a cinematic hologram are not interchangeable.

## Archives checked

| Source | Useful material | Research decision |
|---|---|---|
| [Game UI Database](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/) | Categorized original game map and HUD captures | User-pinned authority. Inspected through the browser; Direct map/HUD pairs checked for GTA V, GTA IV, RDR2, Cyberpunk, Fallout 4, Skyrim, Elden Ring and Saints Row III. |

Its [2019 Cyberpunk article](https://www.hudsandguis.com/home/2019/cyberpunk-2077) is pre-release material, not authority for the retail map. |
| [GameGUI](https://www.gamegui.net/) | Older game interface archive; GTA 3/4, Oblivion, Assassin's Creed | Supplement for era-specific framing and menu hierarchy. |
| [PlayCraft Gallery](https://playcraft.space/gallery/) | Publisher screenshot gallery with map/HUD/component tags | Additional official-release imagery; inspected categories and coverage. |

The retained additional-game source URLs follow below; the local files are private review evidence. Only the 27 game inspirations are offered; the plain Classic map was removed at the user’s request.

## Authored assets and limitations

`generate_materials.py` produces original 16-pixel stone/grass/water tiles, nine pixel control/place sprites, and paper fibre. `Cartography.kt` draws semantic POI glyphs, player pointers and destination shapes, selected by each game's map rules. Compose renders game-specific map composition; map icons and geometry are not screenshots pasted over a functional map. Fonts are bundled with licenses.

No screenshot proves navigation accuracy. Real street connectivity, position, routes and elevations are preserved. Game-authored fictional terrain, unique proprietary fonts and hand-painted map illustrations are not present, so this is not a pixel-exact game asset port. The sourcebook identifies observed similarities and adaptations rather than claiming identity.

## Map versus navigation state — direct database evidence

Full-size captures were downloaded and visually inspected, including line endings, route patterns and marker treatment:

| State | Direct image | Applied decision |
|---|---|---|
| Cyberpunk atlas | [City map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Cyberpunk-207712292020-014137-26627.jpg) | Red building masses; cyan road hierarchy; solid yellow atlas/vehicle guidance. |
| Cyberpunk walking | [Walking radar](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Cyberpunk-207712292020-014340-64291.jpg) | Yellow dotted route when Walk is selected, distinct cyan player chevron. |
| RDR2 atlas | [Selected saloon map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Red-Dead-Redemption-207112020-090844-25672.jpg) | Ink road hierarchy, fine building outlines, dashed paths, red waypoint. Narrowed excessive road casing after native comparison. |
| Fallout atlas | [Pip-Boy map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Fallout-403042021-084648-42721.jpg) | Connected phosphor tabs and subdued terrain detail; real streets remain visible for navigation. |
| Skyrim atlas | [World map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/The-Elder-Scrolls-V-Skyrim07192020-073934-21177.jpg) | Muted cold relief, outlined white symbols and compact lower controls. Geography stays real rather than manufacturing snowy mountains. |
| Elden Ring atlas | [Map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Elden-Ring03022022-114430-89115.jpg) | Warm paper, fine paths, gold circular marks and compass. Painted fictional terrain and sites-of-grace rays are not driving routes and are not fabricated. |
| Saints Row atlas | [Phone map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Saints-Row-The-Third09132020-111621-91368.jpg) | Purple solid route and compact left destination pane. |
| Saints Row navigation | [Driving radar](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Saints-Row-The-Third09132020-111621-17408.jpg) | Live guidance switches to green dots and a yellow player arrow. |

The research images are retained locally in `.tooling/gameuidb/`, not shipped inside the APK or open-source archive. Runtime textures and icons are authored in the project; downloaded full-screen pictures cannot become geographically accurate road tiles.

## Native map fonts

See [map-fonts.md](map-fonts.md) for researched font roles, bundled native SDF stacks, and the distinction between identified original families and licensed substitutes.
