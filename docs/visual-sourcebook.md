# Map and HUD sourcebook

Research for the user's Waypoint Android app, 30 October 2026. These sources inform separately authored Compose controls and real-world map styles. The current worktree retains source links and implementation notes, not a local archive of game screenshots; no source screenshot is packaged as runtime map artwork. Sources show different versions and states, so a pause map, a gameplay radar, a treasure map and a cinematic hologram are not interchangeable.

## Nine additional worlds — 4 November 2026

These actual map/HUD references were visually inspected before implementation. The links below preserve the sources; screenshot copies are not currently retained in the worktree. Shipping maps use real geography, original Compose layouts and original vector emblems; none of these screenshots or game sounds is packaged. The generated previews are native MapLibre captures at the public Indian locations in `WorldPreviewPlaces.kt`. Original completion cues come from `scripts/generate_quest_sounds.py`.

| World | Inspected reference | Original interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dark Zone | [The Division city-map capture](https://www.gamepressure.com/tomclancysdivision/gfx/word/445199038.jpg) | Teal building masses, orange focus details and compact geographic readout. |
| Sea Chart | [Sea of Thieves map-table capture](https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/sea_of_thieves_19_03_2018_14_54_11.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/sea_of_thieves_19_03_2018_14_54_11.png) | Paper ground, ink paths, nautical compass and a dark red route. |
| DOS Atlas | [Turbo Vision text interface](https://github.com/magiblot/tvision) | Monospaced labels, simple line framing and amber roads. Native touch controls; no typing commands. |
| Aincrad | [Bandai Namco’s field-quest screens](https://hr.sao-game.jp/system/quest/field-quest.html) | Warm atlas, white task panels and gold hierarchy inspired by the actual map/quest UI. |
| Tactical Radar | [Counter-Strike radar capture](https://profilerr.net/static/content/thumbs/440x/9/e3/iynr2p-a6662e6a47e1cd0b6525adc5ba4b4e39.png) | Flat building outlines, compact compass and high-contrast route markers. |
| Vector Command | [DEFCON developer gallery](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1520/DEFCON/) | Sparse blue vector geography, fine rules and legible white guidance. |
| Field Ops | [Modern Warfare HUD capture](https://www.gamesradar.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-tips/) | Restrained olive/grey geography, compact direction readout and briefing-style header. |
| 16-bit Quest | [A Link to the Past overworld map](https://www.linkshideaway.com/images/z3/z3overworld_light.gif) | Green atlas, blue water, tan paths and original pixel lettering; real street geometry stays intact. |
| Home Console | [Nintendo’s Wii U Home Menu support capture](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1078/~/forgot-parental-controls-pin-on-wii-u) | Bright white panels, rounded native controls and friendly blue map treatment. |

Quest structure is shared across every world: title-first form, progressive disclosure, task list/detail, predictable actions and readable native body type. World colours are adjusted for text contrast where a decorative map accent would be too faint. The main navigation exposes Quests beside Map, Worlds and Saved.

## Issue #8: Exclusion Zone — 5 November 2026

The [classic S.T.A.L.K.E.R. PDA and quest-journal screenshot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:STALKER%EA%9E%89_Shadow_of_Chernobyl_%E2%80%93_quest_journal.jpg) was visually inspected before implementation. It shows a grey hardware bezel, dark task panels, muted terrain, green targets and amber selected labels. Waypoint's original `StalkerAtlas.kt` adapts that hierarchy to touch: a shallow map bezel, labelled search and location controls, a charcoal/olive quest journal and green real-world route. The catalogue includes a native MapLibre preview and original PDA emblem; the globe and completion sound are generated originals. No fictional hazard readings or anomaly locations are presented as real data. Roboto Condensed is an explicit readable lettering adaptation.

## Original transport markers — 5 November 2026

The user's examples were a horse for the RDR2-inspired Old West and a minecart for Minecraft-inspired Pixel World. `VehicleMarkers.kt` contains original Canvas illustrations for all 38 worlds' Car and Motorcycle modes. Other transport interpretations include fantasy mounts, a ship/rowboat, a carriage/broom, modern vehicles and rovers. These are themed location markers; changing the illustration does not change Car/Motorcycle route costs or turn instructions. Night City now uses one original directional caret in every travel mode, while its POI atlas includes the separately documented game glyphs. An unknown heading still uses a distinct uncertain-position marker.

Car-display comparison used Google Maps in the official Android Auto Desktop Head Unit. Google Maps continued using the phone's real location rather than our public London fixture; a domestic destination provided a stationary guidance reference. Its visible perspective and marker hierarchy informed the implementation, but proprietary camera values and exact same-route parity were not established. Waypoint uses a 50° guidance tilt, speed/turn-dependent zoom, a lower vehicle anchor within the host's visible map area and a flat route overview. [Android's DHU documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing/dhu) documents the simulator and sensor configuration. MapLibre's [image conversion source](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-native/blob/android-v11.13.5/platform/android/MapLibreAndroid/src/main/java/org/maplibre/android/maps/Style.java) establishes that bitmap density controls sprite scale.

The additional-game source URLs follow below; they preserve the research trail without bundling the original images. The catalogue covers all 38 game-inspired worlds; the plain Classic map was removed at the user’s request.

## Map assets and limitations

[`import_imagegen_poi_atlases.py`](../scripts/import_imagegen_poi_atlases.py)
turns separately prompted, original artwork into 36 high-detail POI atlases
and 36 destination markers, with transparent padding and night variants. The
49 atlas symbols correspond to live OpenStreetMap place categories; each
world's icon treatment and separate destination marker are distinct. Night
City's atlas instead combines seven Cyberpunk 2077 glyph sources in ten
directly matching categories with 39 original Waypoint glyphs; its player
caret and destination target are original. The [map icon notes](poi-icon-sources.md)
record the exact source pages, hashes, permission context, and
[day](assets/poi-audit/night-city-icons.webp) and
[night](assets/poi-audit/night-city-icons-night.webp) icon previews. Machine Atlas (NieR) is the
other generator exception: `generate_map_assets.py` draws its original ink
diamonds, monochrome POI glyphs, and destination targets procedurally.
A day/night review of all 38 atlases found shifted crop lines, missing or
reordered cells, and neighboring fragments. Reviewed bounds for the 36 ImageGen
worlds and 92 tracked cell overrides are recorded in the
[`crop manifest`](../tools/imagegen/poi-crop-manifest.json); 43 of those repairs
use the isolated artwork prompted in
[`poi-cell-repairs.jsonl`](../tools/imagegen/poi-cell-repairs.jsonl).
The [contact sheets](poi-atlas-audit.md) show every final day/night pair. Night
glows render within each cell independently.
[`generate_map_assets.py`](../scripts/generate_map_assets.py) provides the
in-house vector fallback and 76 day/night material tiles; it is not the source
of the shipped ImageGen POI artwork. The live-place key names real OSM
categories without inventing game locations. `generate_styles.py`
creates 38 authored day/night MapLibre styles plus two Dark Zone holographic
variants. `scripts/validate_map_assets.py` verifies the 38-world coverage,
transparent padding, and PNG dimensions; the MapLibre style validator reports zero schema errors across
all 78 styles. No game screenshot, imported MapLibre theme, or fictional game
location is used as a runtime map asset; the Night City POI exception above
is explicitly sourced. `Cartography.kt` draws or loads player, transport,
destination, and education markers. `MapChrome.kt` keeps the phone map controls
aligned across worlds, while each world's palette, shape, typography, map key,
and map artwork supply its visual identity.

The Machine Atlas and Night City world-card previews were refreshed from a
connected Android phone against their current MapLibre styles. Other cards
remain earlier captures. The debug-only `WorldPreviewCaptureActivity` writes
each generated day, night, and Dark Zone holographic capture to a distinct
filename.

No screenshot proves navigation accuracy. Real street connectivity, position, routes and elevations are preserved. Game-authored fictional terrain and hand-painted map illustrations are not present; selected licensed game-font families are bundled as documented in the typography notes, so this is not a pixel-exact game asset port. The sourcebook identifies observed similarities and adaptations rather than claiming identity.

## Map versus navigation state — direct database evidence

The direct source images below were visually inspected for line endings, route patterns and marker treatment. Their URLs are retained here; source-image copies are not present in the current worktree:

| State | Direct image | Applied decision |
|---|---|---|
| Cyberpunk atlas | [City map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Cyberpunk-207712292020-014137-26627.jpg) | Red building masses; cyan road hierarchy; solid yellow atlas/vehicle guidance. |
| Cyberpunk walking | [Walking radar](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Cyberpunk-207712292020-014340-64291.jpg) | Yellow dotted route when Walk is selected, distinct cyan player chevron. |
| RDR2 atlas | [Selected saloon map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Red-Dead-Redemption-207112020-090844-25672.jpg) | Ink road hierarchy, fine building outlines, dashed paths, red waypoint. Narrowed excessive road casing after native comparison. |
| Fallout atlas | [Pip-Boy map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Fallout-403042021-084648-42721.jpg) | Connected phosphor tabs and subdued terrain detail; real streets remain visible for navigation. |
| Skyrim atlas | [World map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/The-Elder-Scrolls-V-Skyrim07192020-073934-21177.jpg) | Muted cold relief, outlined white symbols and compact lower controls. Geography stays real rather than manufacturing snowy mountains. |
| Elden Ring atlas | [Map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Elden-Ring03022022-114430-89115.jpg) | Warm paper, fine paths, gold circular marks and compass. Painted fictional terrain and sites-of-grace rays are not driving routes and are not fabricated. |
| Saints Row atlas | [Phone map](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Saints-Row-The-Third09132020-111621-91368.jpg) | Purple solid route and compact left destination pane. |
| Saints Row navigation | [Driving radar](https://www.gameuidatabase.com/uploads/Saints-Row-The-Third09132020-111621-17408.jpg) | Live guidance switches to green dots and a yellow player arrow. |

The source links are retained in this document; game screenshots are not shipped inside the APK or open-source archive. Runtime textures and most icons are authored in the project, with the seven documented Night City map glyphs as the exception; full-screen pictures cannot become geographically accurate road tiles.

## Native map fonts

See [map-fonts.md](map-fonts.md) for researched font roles, bundled native SDF stacks, and the distinction between identified original families and licensed substitutes.

## Authored map styles

`scripts/generate_styles.py` assembles every MapLibre layer, filter, zoom range,
color, road casing, label rule, building treatment, and relief layer from
Waypoint's `cartography_profiles.py`, `map_style_recipes.py`, and
`map_theme_catalog.py`. It has no preset style, sprite, or image input. The app
bundle now contains 78 Waypoint-authored styles for 38 worlds, day and night,
plus Dark Zone's two holographic modes. The local MapLibre style validator
reports zero errors. OpenFreeMap serves OpenMapTiles vector features and OSM
data; generation of style JSON and vector art needs no network access.

## NieR:Automata / Machine Atlas — issue #9

Primary reference: [PlatinumGames’ UI designer Hisayoshi Kijima explains the interface](https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9624) (25 August 2017), including original map, navigation and UI-concept images. The warm beige, charcoal type, square selections, restrained accents and score-like rules inform Waypoint’s original interpretation. Reference screenshots are inspection-only and are not shipped.

Machine Atlas retains real Tokyo Station geography in its native MapLibre preview, extruded real building footprints, legible roads and a rust route with contrasting casing. Its cream, charcoal and rust phone controls use the same aligned placement as the other worlds. The quest palette, car overlay, globe texture, original flight-unit/pod markers, original completion cue and nine authored voice phrases are bundled. Noto Sans is an explicitly identified readable adaptation, not a claim to the game’s original font. Cycling uses an original pedal-cycle marker in each world’s livery; it changes the route profile, unlike decorative Car/Motorcycle marker substitutions.
