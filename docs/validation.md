# Verification record — 30 October 2026

Test device: connected Samsung SM-S948B, 1080 × 2340, density 450, Android 17 development build. Native Kotlin/Compose app, MapLibre Native. Installation and testing used USB debugging.

## Automated checks

`./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug`

- 45 tests pass: 10 route/progress, 4 heading math, 13 heading arbitration/projection/accuracy, 12 repository/service, and 6 catalogue/style regression tests.
- Route tests exercise sparse geometry, turn progression, jitter, off-route movement, crossing roads, looping near the destination, actual arrival, distance units and maneuver instructions.
- Repository tests use a local HTTP test server: query encoding, longitude/latitude ordering, duplicate results, missing names, empty reverse lookup, rate limiting, server errors, valid geometry/maneuvers, missing routes, remote road snaps, malformed JSON, dedicated motorcycle and pedestrian costing.
- Android lint: zero errors. Dependency-version and deprecated-API warnings remain; no claim of a warning-free report.
- All 27 style JSON files pass the official MapLibre style validator (zero errors), have unique layer IDs, valid source references, valid top-level camera expressions, and retain the connected road classes.

## Actual phone interactions

- Install/start and repeated app restarts; GPS opt-in is retained.
- Precise permission granted through Android's system dialog; actual position fixes reported approximately ±3–5 m during stationary tests.
- Verified Android registered Waypoint's hardware rotation-vector listener at a requested 20 ms sample interval. Settings exposes provider, sensors, compass confidence, satellite count and position accuracy.
- Search for a nearby named destination, select a result, render a road route and inspect turns.
- Car route: approximately 3.9 km / 7 min. Motorcycle: approximately 3.7 km / 16 min. Walking: approximately 3.6 km / 45 min. These are one test's estimates, not fixed demonstration data. Motorcycle/walking used Valhalla's actual dedicated profiles, with no car fallback.
- Start navigation, display next turn, ETA, remaining distance and stationary speed; end navigation.
- Navigation service remained present while the Activity was backgrounded. This is not a long-duration battery/endurance test.
- Save the selected destination and find it on Saved.
- The device loop exercised all offered atlas transitions while location and orientation listeners ran. A separate stationary route test confirmed that preview and active-guidance world changes preserve the selected destination and route. Large-text (1.3×) guidance, landscape and credits-dialog interactions were captured. The final optimized build is verified separately below.

## Issues fixed during development

- A per-theme width transformation wrapped zoom interpolation in multiplication. Native MapLibre discarded those road layers. The generator now scales interpolation output stops while preserving top-level camera expressions. Native street rendering was recaptured and confirmed; two regression tests and the official full-style validator cover the failure.
- Theme switching could leave a ValueAnimator pointing at a destroyed native SymbolLayer, causing a native crash. Animators now cancel synchronously before style replacement and disposal, with epoch guards on callbacks.
- A repeated readiness value could skip theme camera updates. Each style completion now uses a monotonic generation so camera/source effects rerun.
- Reverse-geocoding failure no longer leaves the demo city label on a live GPS map. A neutral Current area label and bounded retries replace the one-shot lookup.

- Null GeoJSON geometry caused a MapLibre native startup crash. Empty sources now use an empty FeatureCollection. No recurrence was observed after that fix in the subsequent test sessions.
- Custom POI labels requested unavailable default glyph fonts. They now use named bundled SDF stacks, with provider Noto fallback for other script ranges. MapLibre initializes before the HTTP glyph resolver.
- Excessive POI labels obscured the street network. Relevant categories are filtered and names reveal at closer zoom.
- GPS opt-in and 2D/3D preference now survive restarts.
- Compass heading wraps across north correctly; source/camera work was separated to avoid re-uploading routes for every sensor update.
- Light HUD panels now use their own dark text/secondary colors. Long fantasy titles use a smaller atlas font size. Native radio/tab semantics expose selection.
- Search/route errors provide recovery; changing transport mode invalidates the previous route.

## Limits of this verification

No physical road test, tunnel/urban-canyon test, long drive, audible-speaker verification, battery benchmark, or Android Auto head-unit/DHU test was performed. Reroute/arrival logic is unit tested, not observed during a real journey. An actual tablet was not available. Landscape and text scaling use the connected phone. The integration is a personal prototype, not production navigation certification.

The maps re-create visual design rules from game screenshots. Real-world geography and original assets mean they are not pixel-perfect replicas of proprietary, hand-authored game atlases. Terrain shading uses real elevation data; no fictional relief is invented. Public routing/search services have availability and rate limits; offline routing is not included. No live-traffic source is configured, so traffic overlay and traffic-adjusted ETA are not available or part of the validation scope.

Native captures in `.impeccable/review/` contain the user's local geography and are ignored by Git and excluded from the source archive.

## UI and performance changes

- Labelled map tools replace icon-only actions; style/game name hierarchy is uniform in the launcher and Worlds library. Bohemia and Surface Map compasses are positioned in content flow to avoid overlapping lower controls.
- A native welcome screen offers world selection and Open map. Map rendering is deferred until entry; active navigation and external destination links retain their own entry behavior.
- Preview thumbnails batch their geometry into cached paths. The native map renderer and its camera/marker work pause behind lists and sheets. Sensor readings remain current in the arbiter while hidden screens avoid heading-driven state emissions.
- All 27 HUD palette foreground, accent and secondary pairs were checked against their alpha-composited panels over black and white underlays; minimum tested ratio was 6.14:1. This does not measure every label drawn directly over terrain.
- R8/resource shrinking was enabled for the original private release build. The existing signing identity is retained for compatible upgrades. Later releases use the public GitHub distribution described below; no public-store release is claimed.

## Historical private release verification (0.1.x)

The optimized release installed on the phone passed all 45 unit tests and Android lint with zero errors (35 warnings). The 27 styles also pass the official validator. Four connected-device test flows passed across the final targeted runs:

- `AtlasSmokeTest`: all 27 idle worlds with live location/sensor updates, captured individually.
- `WelcomeUiTest`: launch, Witcher search/selection, entry and Back, 1.3× text, and 2× text with animations disabled.
- `NavigationUiTest`: actual GPS route, retained destination/route across world changes in preview and guidance, 1.3× text, landscape, end-trip, idle Western map and map credits.
- `LibraryScrollTest`: ten flings through the catalogue with the native map covered.

The final navigation and scrolling run reports `OK (2 tests)`; the welcome flow passed separately and the 27-world loop passed before the isolated picker/footer corrections. Those corrections do not change idle atlas composition. Early test-harness failures caused by release dependency stripping, rotation timing, and edge gestures were corrected; failed runs are not counted as passes. Test-owned font, animation and orientation settings were restored.

Final scrolling measurement: 920 rendered frames, 36 missed deadlines (3.91%), median 6 ms, 95th percentile 10 ms, 99th percentile 18 ms. The earlier debug capture measured 24.78% and a 27 ms 95th percentile. This compares a debug build with an optimized build and test gestures differ slightly at the screen edge; it is not a controlled benchmark isolating one optimization, nor a promise of zero stutter. No app crash was present in the device crash buffer during the successful release checks from 18:29 onward.

Visual corrections include single-line Locate/Settings captions, non-wrapping End trip/Steps labels at 1.3×, a backed route toolbar, and clipping thumbnail drawing to its preview bounds so descriptions retain their contrast. The installed APK hash was checked against the built release file. Private device captures stay outside the source archive.

The finish review identified one remaining material defect: route endpoints could sit behind preview controls. The correction uses measured overlay bounds and a flat, north-up overview camera, including the actual position and selected destination. A final navigation run passed after recapturing GTA, Witcher and Cyberpunk previews, plus Witcher at 1.3× text in portrait and landscape. The compact panel retains the complete Start navigation action; Save/Saved remains a single line. These changes preserve the reviewed idle atlas compositions.

The independent verdict pass returned **ship** for this scored route-preview fix: all three refreshed previews show the complete route and both endpoints clear of controls; Witcher's 1.3× portrait and landscape previews retain a fully visible Start navigation action. No regression was observed in the refreshed large-text or landscape guidance captures. This bounded verdict does not certify the whole application or replace real-road validation.

## GitHub release extension (0.2.0)

The new updater and release preparation pass 60 unit tests (the existing 45 plus 15 release-parser cases), with zero failures, and Android lint with zero errors (37 warnings). All 27 map styles still validate. Device tests captured six worlds at explicit demonstration coordinates, the welcome/library, and the updater. `UpdateUiTest` exercised Settings, the installed version, a manual live GitHub check, the not-yet-published release error and retry control, then Back. These checks passed; private status bars were cropped out of published README images.

At the time of the 0.2.0 preparation checks, repository creation, signing-secret setup and live release testing were pending. That is a historical checkpoint: the repository is now public, GitHub CLI authorization and encrypted signing-secret setup are complete, and the corrected workflow passes. The current release and device-validation status appears below.

The independent UI review accepted the captured README and native updater idle/error layouts. Its single material fix was stale private-only product context; the verdict pass marked that documentation fix **ship**. This verdict does not certify the still-pending GitHub release or download/installation path. The locally built 0.2.0 APK is installed on the connected phone, with its installed SHA-256 verified against the packaged file.

## Security hardening and release preparation (0.2.1)

Normal development verification after remediation:

- Debug and optimized release builds succeed with Gradle 8.14.6 and AndroidX Car 1.8.0-rc01.
- Both variants pass **82 unit tests**, with zero failures, errors or skips. Added cases cover destination parsing/import generations, strict JSON nesting and value limits, invalid provider fields, redirect rejection, oversized known-length/chunked/gzip responses, geometry limits and request cancellation.
- Android lint reports **0 errors and 35 warnings** for each variant. Warnings remain; this is not a warning-free build claim.
- All **27 map styles** pass the official style validator. Version metadata passes the release-version check.
- Debug instrumentation APK compiles. New read-only tests are ready to check the installed package's disabled/private car component, private update provider, backup and cleartext policy; they have not yet run on a reconnected phone.
- Packaged debug/release manifest checks pass and are now CI gates. The car service is disabled and non-exported; the release is not debuggable. This verifies build output, not cross-UID exploit behavior.
- The historical remediation workflow passed Android SDK setup, the debug build, unit tests, lint, map styles and the packaged-component gate. Its superseded run was retired during the public-history privacy cleanup.
- The README was rendered through GitHub's Markdown renderer and visually inspected in Helium at desktop width and in a 390px iframe. Its hero, paired screenshot gallery and text wrapping were reviewed. The full gallery images remain linked at original size.

The completed standard security audit accounts for 31 coverage units and six independently verified needs-validation records, with no runtime-confirmed exploit. Both audit schema/coverage validators pass. It uses a frozen source snapshot of the earlier baseline; normal remediation builds above are separate development checks. No adversarial Binder/deep-link test was run on a personal phone or deployed service. The audit's required isolated execution controls were unavailable; see [security notes](security.md).

At release preparation, the previously connected phone is absent from ADB. The final in-app download/cancel/installer-handoff smoke test and installation of the GitHub-built APK therefore remain pending until it reconnects. Earlier device checks above remain historical evidence, not new 0.2.1 device results.

## Live navigation, search and launcher icon (0.2.2)

These checks address the reported stale pointer/route and missing search matches. Earlier evidence above is historical.

- **104 unit tests per build variant** cover the existing security/update boundaries plus sustained deviation, opposite-direction travel, noisy and batched fixes, retry backoff, route-line trimming, camera-follow policy, typo/spacing/accent matching, category shortcuts, provider fallback, cache reuse, cancellation and the confirmed search alias.
- **NavigationJourneyTest: three connected-device tests passed.** An isolated controller receives synthetic London fixes through the production location handler, with a controlled routing provider. The tests verify position/progress advancement, replacement geometry after a missed turn, retained motorcycle mode/destination, stale/poor-fix handling, and recovery after a simulated routing outage. They do not replace the device's location provider or change saved places.
- **MapFollowingTest passed on the phone.** Native MapLibre source coordinates and camera target are checked during and after movement. A real touch pan pauses guidance following; it recentres after eight seconds. The test also changes world while the position renderer is active. The remaining line starts at the user, with the travelled line removed.
- **SearchCoverageTest passed against live services on the phone.** Station and alternate-spelling queries returned provider results with their actual coordinates and addresses. Approximate, unrelated results are removed when a strong match exists. This verifies the exercised queries at test time, not all places or all devices. Private example queries and locations are intentionally omitted.
- **LauncherIconTest passed.** The manifest references an Android adaptive icon, its monochrome layer is present, and native renders cover the normal mark plus light/dark wallpaper-derived tints at 112 dp and 48 dp. Samsung may wrap icons returned by PackageManager; the test checks the declared adaptive drawable before native rendering. The two game-independent icon colours are not applied to game-map palettes.
- The final combined device run reports **OK (6 tests)** in 53.47 seconds. Debug and release each pass **104 unit tests**, and the packaged-manifest boundary checks plus all **27 map styles** pass. Android lint reports **0 errors / 35 existing warnings** in each build variant.
- The two read-only `SecurityConfigurationTest` checks also pass on the connected phone: the car service remains disabled/private, the update provider remains private, and backup/cleartext boundaries remain enforced.
- Two initial instrumentation harness problems (a non-void JUnit method and Samsung's wrapped package icon) were corrected and rerun. They are not counted as successful tests.

Native captures and device logs stay under ignored `.tooling/` / `.impeccable/review/`. Only the standalone icon rendered from original vector resources is published. No user trip screenshots or status bars are added to public documentation.

**Not established by these checks:** real moving-road accuracy, difficult GNSS/magnetic environments, distinguishing roads inside the position uncertainty, screen-off endurance/battery behaviour, or Google Maps-equivalent global place coverage. A real-road check is still needed; no claim of perfect navigation is made.


## Public examples and promotional README (0.2.3)

- Debug and release builds each pass **106 unit tests**. The new tests cover empty-by-default, instance-local spelling aliases and rejection of invalid alias entries. Android lint remains **0 errors / 35 warnings** per variant; all **27 map styles** and both packaged-manifest gates pass.
- **SearchAliasStorageTest: three device tests pass.** Synthetic private-preference fixtures verify that a confirmed spelling reaches the provider and that malformed/non-string storage safely preserves the original query.
- **Navigation and icon regressions: five device tests pass.** The three controlled journey tests, native camera-follow test and adaptive-icon test were rerun successfully after the privacy change.
- **SearchCoverageTest passes with fixed public London landmarks** against the live phone providers. Two read-only component/security tests also pass. Private search examples are excluded from committed fixtures and public notes.
- Promotional artwork is composed from existing, sanitised native London demo captures and the original adaptive icon. All public image files were checked for EXIF/GPS metadata; none is present.
- GitHub's Markdown renderer preserves the responsive picture sources. Browser captures at **1280px desktop and 390px mobile** show loaded images, dedicated mobile compositions, and no document-level horizontal overflow. Code blocks retain their normal internal scrolling.

Public release descriptions use neutral feature descriptions. The current source tree is checked for private sample queries, device identifiers and local account paths. The affected earlier commit and release were replaced with cleaned public history. Author, committer and annotated-tag identities use the public GitHub handle and no-reply email. A fresh remote clone verifies the rewritten history and identical file trees. Copies already downloaded or cached elsewhere cannot be recalled.

## Published APK and updater verification (0.2.3)

- The [tagged GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/actions/runs/41098264439) passed the debug verification job and signed release build, including unit tests, lint and packaged-component checks. It published the APK and checksum file to [v0.2.3](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/releases/tag/v0.2.3).
- The downloaded APK's SHA-256 matches both GitHub's asset digest and `SHA256SUMS`. Its package, version, non-debuggable release flag and existing signing identity were independently checked.
- A connected-device test on the previous signed release passed the live update flow: discovery, download cancellation, re-download, signature verification and handoff to Android's installer. The partial download file was absent after verification.
- After installing the verified GitHub APK, a second device test confirmed the installed version and manual update check. The screen reported **Waypoint 0.2.3** and **You're up to date**.
- The installed APK was read back and its hash matched the downloaded GitHub artifact. The test package was removed and normal device sleep restored. These two additional updater checks do not expand the real-road or endurance coverage described above.

## Onboarding and frame-time pass (2 November 2026)

- Connected Samsung phone, 1080 × 2340 at up to 120 Hz, debug build. Device test data/cache were cleared before each run.
- The opening globe's hidden fallback stickers kept animating under the video. After the fallback stops when video is ready and sticker motion uses render translation, a warmed 10-second `dumpsys gfxinfo` sample changed from **447 missed frames / 605 rendered** to **0 / 304**. The video remained visible in a native screenshot.
- The Worlds picker now decodes full preview artwork on a background dispatcher, keeps up to 32 MB of recent images, and preloads nearby cards. The same five-swipe check changed from **30 missed frames / 310 rendered** to **16 / 331** after the final placeholder pass. Original full-size artwork remains in the repository and cards were visually checked after scrolling.
- Map marker images and style JSON are prepared off the UI thread. Native MapLibre image submission remains synchronous: its asynchronous variant caused a rapid world-switch tilt regression and was removed. A single 65–73 ms frame was still observed during a debug theme switch; this pass does not claim zero jank for that transition.
- The separate voice-guidance onboarding page was removed. The horse animation page now explains turn-by-turn voice guidance and leads directly to the referral page; system Back returns to the horse page.
- `HorseOnboardingTest`, `WorldsScrollPositionTest`, `MapTiltWorldsTest` and `MapLocateWorldsTest` passed on the phone. The latter two exercise all 27 worlds. Debug assembly, unit tests, lint and `git diff --check` passed. No changes were pushed.

## Global real-place scenarios (2 November 2026)

- Added `GlobalScenariosTest` with 50 approximate settlement centres across 25 countries, pairing large cities with towns or villages. The set includes Kolkata/Ziro, Tokyo/Shirakawa-go, New York/Marfa, London/Bibury, São Paulo/Paraty, Cairo/Siwa, Sydney/Coober Pedy and Dubai/Hatta. Ziro's initial test point was at its airfield; the fixture was corrected to the town before the final run.
- On the connected Samsung, all **50/50** places loaded the requested world style and real road/building features after MapLibre reported a completed render. The camera and position marker stayed at the requested place. The test captures one screenshot per place; screenshots were reviewed as contact sheets, with individual checks for Tokyo and Ziro.
- The production search flow returned a nearby result in **50/50** places. The production routing repository returned a usable driving route in **50/50** places, and the navigation engine progressed along each route to arrival. Walking and motorcycle profiles each returned usable routes in **16/16** geographically spread urban/rural places.
- Six live routes rendered in the actual navigation screen across different worlds and modes. The Ziro walking case exposed premature “Arrive at your destination” guidance on a long final leg; the banner and navigation notification now say “Continue on NH13” until close to arrival. A unit test covers the distance transition, and the corrected screen was visually checked.
- Existing `NavigationJourneyTest` (3 tests), `MapFollowingTest`, `MapLocateWorldsTest` (27 worlds) and `MapTiltWorldsTest` (27 worlds) passed after this change. Device test data/cache were cleared before each invocation.
- This was a connected, stationary test using public location coordinates and live map/search/routing services; it did not involve travelling to 25 countries or verifying each road on the ground. Sparse rural detail is limited by available map tiles. The phone briefly lost DNS/TCP access to the public routing endpoint during one rerun; later device requests and the full routing suites succeeded.

## Repository hygiene and release packaging (2 November 2026)

- Removed unused Android stills and an obsolete globe-frame generator. At that checkpoint, three MP4s were retained; a later cleanup archived the unused icon-collage clip. The remaining two runtime videos are referenced by the welcome or onboarding UI. Remotion now stages its temporary images from the committed Android resources instead of tracking duplicate copies.
- Moved source screenshots, render outputs, reference imagery, local APKs, review notes and logs out of the repository. A CI hygiene check rejects those artifacts, unreferenced `drawable-nodpi` images, runtime videos without a source reference, missing README images, and basic private-path, personal-email and secret patterns.
- The cleaned source passed offline debug and release assembly, unit tests, Android lint, both packaged-manifest checks, version validation, 28 style JSON checks, Remotion ESLint/TypeScript checks, `git diff --check` and the new repository hygiene check. The local release APK was intentionally unsigned because no distribution credentials were supplied.
- A current-tree text scan found no local account paths, personal email addresses or key-shaped strings. One six-decimal, device-like location in a camera test was replaced with an approximate public Kolkata centre; CI now flags overly precise coordinate literals in device tests. A scan of 162 tracked images found no GPS or personal-path metadata markers. One onboarding JPEG has EXIF limited to dimensions, resolution and colour space; the three runtime videos contain only container, encoder and Remotion tags. These checks do not establish that every visible place name or future screenshot is safe to publish; contributors still review public examples manually.

## Android Auto driving view (3 November 2026)

- Compared Google Maps and Waypoint on the same Android Auto Desktop Head Unit and shared destination. Google Maps showed a flat route overview before Start, then a tilted, heading-up driving camera with the car low on screen and a closer view near turns. Waypoint now uses that camera behavior while keeping the phone's selected world palette and its own map design. Google Maps and Waypoint use different route providers, so their roads, duration, and ETA can differ.
- On the connected Samsung phone and Desktop Head Unit, imported a `geo:` destination, verified its resolved place name and full route line in the car preview, then started guidance on the phone and watched it appear in the car. A simulated drive showed the route line, moving car marker, changing heading, speed, remaining distance, ETA, and left/right turn cues. Near-turn look-ahead is limited so the marker remains visible as the map zooms in. Switching the phone from Los Santos to Old West and back during guidance changed the car's map and route palette without ending the trip.
- The car map now renders through a live MapLibre surface rather than a repeated snapshot. Position and camera updates interpolate between guidance fixes, with native rendering capped at 60 fps. A SurfaceFlinger sample during an active simulated drive recorded 62 map frames, 61 consecutive frame intervals with a 16.79 ms median, 60 intervals between 15 and 18 ms, and no gap above 25 ms. This is a short Desktop Head Unit observation, not a guarantee for every car display or route.
- Android Auto's navigation template still receives route and maneuver data through the Car App Library, including native turn, fork, merge, ramp and roundabout types; the Desktop Head Unit did not display its standard instruction card in this setup, so Waypoint also draws a compact driving cue on the map. Route, destination, car marker, and cue were checked together in the head-unit view.
- Final debug and release assembly, Android test APK assembly, debug and release unit tests, debug and release lint, and both packaged-manifest checks passed. The installed final debug APK passed eight connected-device tests across car compatibility, navigation journey and security configuration. A physical vehicle, long-duration drive, and measured performance on production car hardware remain untested.

## Phone and dashboard regression pass (3 November 2026)

- On the connected Samsung, the complete final-build global scenario class passed `OK (5 tests)` in 261 seconds. Its 50-place fixtures covered 25 countries: all 50 map positions showed road features and a position marker, all 50 nearby searches returned a result, and all 50 driving routes progressed to arrival. Walking and motorcycle routing succeeded at all 16 additional urban/rural fixtures for each mode. Six actual phone navigation screens were captured and reviewed across Kolkata, Ziro, Tokyo, London, São Paulo and Dubai in six different world styles. The route line, maneuver, and trip controls remained visible.
- The phone's 2D/3D camera and Locate loops each passed in all 27 worlds on the revised build (`OK (2 tests)`). A stationary tilt toggle had revealed that the camera update condition ignored a tilt-only change; that condition now includes tilt. The synthetic Locate tests were isolated from live GPS to make their results deterministic. The route, onboarding, large-text, landscape, catalogue scroll, car-template and journey suites passed in later targeted runs, including `OK (10 tests)` and `OK (9 tests)` on the final installed debug build.
- The current onboarding was exercised from the opening globe through referral, favorite game, map selection and location choice, including 1.3× and 2× text with reduced motion. The navigation UI run verified a nearby route, world changes before and during guidance, 1.3× text, landscape, ending the trip and map information. Test fixtures now set up their own saved destination and welcome state instead of depending on a fresh install.
- The updater settings UI passed its final device check. The live GitHub endpoint returned a rate-limit response during this pass; Waypoint showed the specific error and a usable **Try again** action. This validates error presentation, not a successful download or installer handoff in this run.
- A jump between distant GPS locations exposed a stale preview route when the replacement request failed. The preview now clears its old line while requesting a route and leaves it clear after an error; active guidance keeps its current route during rerouting. A connected-device regression test covers the failure and recovery behavior. The crossing of the International Date Line is covered by car overview and look-ahead tests. Another test checks car camera overview bounds across seven northern/southern/date-line journeys and four display sizes.
- Android Auto Desktop Head Unit runs used a 60 fps configuration at 800 × 480, 1280 × 720, 1920 × 1080, and 1280 × 720 with top/bottom margins for a wide effective viewport. The checked-in `scripts/dhu-60fps.ini` reproduces the 720p configuration; change its resolution or marginheight for the other cases. Screenshots were inspected for route visibility, destination title, marker, cue, map controls and clipped/overlapping content. Day/night and driving restrictions were toggled on the 480p layout. A shared `geo:` destination was accepted on the car, reverse-resolved to **Hooghly Ghat**, routed, and started on the phone; the head unit showed its live route and maneuver changes during Android Auto's `AUTO_DRIVE` simulation. Car template tests also verified preview and active controls for all 27 worlds, an untrusted host rejection, shared-destination consent, GPS loss and roundabout exit cues.
- A SurfaceFlinger sample of the car map during an active 1080p simulated drive contained 54 frames: median interval **19.09 ms**, 95th percentile **20.88 ms**, one interval above 25 ms, and none above 33 ms. The MapLibre surface is capped at 60 fps, but this 1080p observation did **not** sustain 60 fps. The earlier short lower-resolution sample measured a 16.79 ms median. Neither result predicts every dashboard or certifies a constant frame rate.
- A navigation-only continuous-render trial at 1080p measured 18.90 ms median and 20.44 ms at the 95th percentile in a different world style. It still did not sustain 60 fps, and it rendered unchanged frames continuously, so the trial was reverted. The retained map uses render-on-change with interpolated position and camera updates.
- Final debug and release unit suites passed **124 tests each**, with zero failures; debug/release assembly, Android test APK assembly, lint, packaged-manifest security checks, repository hygiene and whitespace checks passed. Lint reported zero errors (57 debug and 51 release warnings). Device screenshots and latency samples are kept outside the repository.

This pass was stationary and used simulated trips and public coordinates. The 50 international journeys were exercised through production search/routing and the phone map, with synthetic position updates; the actual Desktop Head Unit drive was local. A temporary system GPS test provider did not reliably displace Google Play Services' fused fix in the car session, so it was removed after the failed international projection attempt. No physical vehicle, offline map/routing test, long-duration endurance run, production head-unit benchmark, or claim of exact Google Maps parity is included.

## 1.1.0 release preparation and README captures (3 November 2026)

- The updated source builds debug and optimized release APKs, builds the Android test APK, passes **126 debug and 126 release unit tests**, and passes debug/release Android lint. Packaged debug and release manifest boundary checks, version validation for `1.1.0` / `1001000`, repository hygiene, all **28** generated map styles, and `git diff --check` pass. The local release APK is intentionally unsigned; GitHub Actions owns distribution signing.
- The connected Samsung passed **11 targeted Android tests** across car compatibility, navigation journeys and security configuration on the installed debug navigation code. The final version metadata and updated release-prompt copy were compiled in the 1.1.0 build; the device test APK used the same navigation source before that version bump.
- The opt-in `CarReadmeCaptureTest` passed on the phone while connected to the Android Auto Desktop Head Unit. It requested a route between fixed public London coordinates, supplied a simulated guidance state, and projected Old West and Night City. The DHU's own `screenshot` command captured both 1280 × 720 displays. The opt-in `ReadmeScreenshotsTest` also passed and supplied six fixed-London phone map states. Status/navigation bars and image metadata were removed before the public posters were generated; source captures remain outside Git.
- The README now shows both dashboard captures in responsive posters and refreshed phone images. The SDK 36 workflow install now matches the app's compile SDK. Publication and the installed-app update prompt require the signed `v1.1.0` GitHub release; a push to `main` alone does not create an update.

## Published 1.1.0 and update discovery (3 November 2026)

- The [main verification run](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/actions/runs/41531016389) and [tagged release run](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/actions/runs/41531832476) both passed. The latter published the stable [v1.1.0 release](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/releases/tag/v1.1.0) with `Waypoint.apk` and `SHA256SUMS`.
- A fresh download of the 1.1.0 APK passed `apksigner verify`; its SHA-256 matched both the checksum file and GitHub's asset digest (`ff3532806f9be490bdfb328f871d6035c10e1524d1516daed937ee55cc388e96`). The APK declares `com.waypoint.app`, version `1.1.0` / `1001000`, and the same signing certificate as the published 1.0.0 APK.
- The connected phone retained its installed 1.0.0 debug build and saved data. After the stable release appeared, reopening Waypoint showed the **Waypoint 1.1.0 is ready** popup with the published release notes and **Download update** action. No download or installer handoff was attempted on that debug-signed installation because its signer differs from the published release. The matching published release certificates and higher version code establish the signed in-place update prerequisites; final installation confirmation remains with Android and the user.

## Local issue fixes — 4 November 2026

Changes were implemented in issue creation order. The README includes the Repolode badge. The release notes, including reporter
credits, are in [releases/1.5.0.md](releases/1.5.0.md).

| Issue | Local result | Evidence and remaining limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| #1 — voice guidance | Fixed missing explicit `AndroidTtsObserver.start()`; added initialization/error states, English voice selection, retry and pending-cue cleanup | Six voice lifecycle unit tests pass. On a physical Android 17 phone, the installed engine initialized, accepted a synthetic navigation utterance and the tester confirmed hearing it. No real route was used. |
| #2 — Android Auto missing from launcher | Launcher setup and distribution requirements documented; manifest checks expanded; issue remains open | Packaged service discovery, descriptor, car API metadata and permissions pass. Installed Android Auto host signature validation and four simulated car-template tests pass. Both the installed release and isolated local test build appear in the Desktop Head Unit launcher and open their maps. Real-car launcher eligibility is **not resolved or verified**. |
| #3 — launcher visibility and silent guidance | Voice fix shared with #1; launcher finding shared with #2 | Same evidence and outstanding real-car distribution check. |
| #4 — selecting multiple favourite games | Toggle events read the latest saved selection, with checkmarks, count and announced states | Device regression selects/deselects several games, navigates Back, recreates the activity and completes onboarding; selected preferences and initial world are verified. Normal and 1.3× text layouts inspected. |
| #5 — UK spelling | Android default/UK resources for onboarding, world descriptions, recenter controls and car credits/units | Device resource tests verify UK and US variants. The physical onboarding screen displays “favourite” under the device's UK locale. Provider place names and game names are preserved. |
| #6 — missing Twitter option | Added Twitter / X and a scrolling referral list | Device onboarding test selects Twitter / X and continues. Layout inspected on the physical phone. |
| #7 — feature wishlist | Deferred at the maintainer's request | Separate task. |

Verification: 133 local JVM tests, debug APK/instrumentation compilation, Android lint,
version checks, packaged-manifest checks, repository hygiene and whitespace checks passed.
Seven focused device tests passed across `GuidanceVoiceDeviceTest`, `OnboardingIssuesTest`
and `CarCompatibilityTest`. The car tests require precise-location permission; without it
the app correctly returns a permission message instead of a navigation template. The
onboarding accessibility assertion refreshes cached nodes before reading their announced state.

Device testing used a separately installed `Waypoint Local Test` package. The existing
Waypoint installation and its stored data were not replaced. Captures and test logs remain
in ignored local directories; they are not public release artwork. Synthetic speech acceptance
and simulated car templates do not establish real-road timing, rerouting audio reliability,
Bluetooth audio behavior or real-head-unit launcher availability.

### Desktop Head Unit launcher check

Google's Desktop Head Unit 2.0 (macOS ARM64) connected to the physical Android 17 phone
through Android Auto's developer head-unit server and ADB port 5277. USB accessory mode
failed to attach, so the documented ADB connection was used. Both the installed release
(`com.waypoint.app`) and isolated local build (`com.waypoint.app.localtest`) appeared as
separate entries in the projected launcher. Opening the release rendered Liberty City;
opening the local build rendered Los Santos, and its map settings opened successfully.
Android Auto's projection process was bound to the respective car service. No installer
identity or host-validation policy was changed for this check.

This verifies launcher discovery and map presentation in the DHU on this phone. It does
not reproduce the reporter's real-car failure or establish real-car distribution eligibility.
Issue #2 remains open. The simulator was stopped and the ADB forwarding removed afterward.


## Issue #7 candidate — quests, sharing and 36 worlds (4 November 2026)

This is the local 1.6.0 candidate; the published 1.5.0 release is unchanged. The optional quest system, personal progression, incoming/outgoing map handoff and nine bundled worlds follow the agreed scope. Multiplayer, trip sharing, community uploads, game-folder importing and cloud synchronization are excluded.

- Debug and optimized release builds pass **145 unit tests each**, with zero failures. Debug/release lint has zero errors (85/79 warnings). Version validation, both packaged-manifest boundary checks, **37 style files** (36 worlds and their shared base), and whitespace checks pass. The unsigned optimized APK is 93,047,614 bytes versus the published signed 1.5.0 APK at 87,551,880 bytes: approximately **6.3% larger**; final signing changes the exact size.
- The isolated **Waypoint Preview** installation on the connected Samsung Android 17 phone passed the final three quest UI/adaptive tests. They exercise title-first creation, editing, a saved-place attachment and destination preview, explicit completion and Undo, pause/resume after activity recreation, profile rewards, new-world preview/application, and incoming shared-place confirmation. Large text up to 200%, small-phone layout, landscape and reduced-motion settings were exercised. Tablet-sized captures use display overrides on this phone; they are not separate tablet hardware evidence.
- The corrected car/location regression invocation passed **five tests**, including trusted/untrusted car-host checks, car preview/guidance controls across all 36 worlds, incoming-place consent and GPS recovery templates, and Locate/recentering across all 36 worlds. Test setup explicitly grants precise location and isolates synthetic fixes from device GPS. The earlier combined run also passed map following, tilt controls across all 36 worlds, speech-engine and security-configuration checks; its car/Locate failures were corrected in the test fixtures and rerun successfully.
- The final permission-denial and connected-car UI checks passed **two tests**. Quests explains that notifications are optional and the timer remains usable with alerts denied. Selecting Quests during an Android Auto connection keeps the map available and explains when task editing returns. This check caught and fixed a retained callback reading stale car state; tab selection now reads the current controller state.
- **Eleven background/persistence/photo tests passed.** A short synthetic focus countdown used real Android alarms while the physical screen was off and battery saver was active. The alert arrived without completing the quest or awarding XP. Repeated Complete notification actions awarded one reward; replaying the old action after reopening did not complete the quest. The test temporarily simulated unplugged power because USB charging suppresses battery saver, then restored normal battery reporting, power mode and alarm access. This is a short functional check, not an endurance or security exploit test.
- Database tests cover concurrent completion, stale action revisions, Undo, anonymous rewards after deletion, a single running timer, no early-finish bonus, clock changes, reminder consumption and explicit confirmation after simulated reboot expiry. Closing and reopening an on-disk Room database preserves quest text, a paused timer and reward records. Photo tests verify orientation, private resized copies, metadata removal and rejection of invalid schemes/paths. A separate two-stage device check then prepared a running timer and reward, force-stopped the Preview process, and reopened its data in a fresh test process. The task note, reward and original timer ID/start time persisted; remaining time decreased rather than resetting. Both stages passed. A real phone reboot remains untested.
- All nine new MapLibre preview images were rendered on the phone. The 45 shipping raster assets in the audited drawable/globe folders carry provenance metadata. The independent native design review cleared its six interface findings after refreshed captures: landscape task visibility, labelled Locate actions, explicit GPS states, named switches, compact rail spacing and full-width status-bar contrast. The verdict covers those fixes; it is not a claim of full TalkBack or keyboard testing.

The five-person novice usability study has **not** been performed; its protocol is in [usability study protocol](research/usability-study-protocol.md). Older Android runtime coverage, actual tablet hardware, real-vehicle eligibility, long-duration battery behavior and a signed in-place update remain separate release checks. The available local disk space was insufficient to add an older Android emulator image during this pass. Phone test captures, logs and development APKs remain ignored local artifacts.

## Android Auto session and menu integration (1.6 development)

Normal functional QA on the Preview package, separate from adversarial security evidence:

- Fifteen physical-device checks passed across `CarSessionTest` (4), `CarCompatibilityTest` (4), `CarMenusTest` (2), `CarNavigationSyncTest` (1), and `NavigationJourneyTest` (4). They cover session ownership across menus/background/reconnection, host authentication, shared settings, complete world selection, trip publication/cleanup, and navigation journeys. These results precede the later 37th-world menu extension.
- A separate denied-location run passed `CarPermissionRecoveryTest` (1), including the parked-only permission action and recovery to the navigation template. Original Preview permissions were restored.
- `CarHostJourneyTest` passed against the real Android Auto Desktop Head Unit at 1280 × 720. The operator pressed the host's actual Start and End actions with the phone activity backgrounded. Assertions verified a foreground `NavigationService`, native Ferrostar progress advancing over a public London route, and service removal after End. The test used app-local simulation, not a global mock-location provider. Instrumentation can affect execution eligibility; this does not establish every real-vehicle/background-policy combination.
- Phone Android Auto setup was visually inspected at normal and 2× text at 360dp width. The successful first adaptive run also tested an 800dp portrait layout. The rotation setting was ignored while projecting, so its landscape-labelled captures are **not** counted as landscape evidence. The fixture now uses explicit wide display sizes and an aspect-ratio assertion; a fresh wide-layout run is required.
- Debug JVM checks passed after the navigation session gate change (153 tests at that source checkpoint). The three new gate cases cover stale queued replacements, serialized trip transitions and exception cleanup. Earlier debug/release tests and optimized release/lint passed before this gate change; the final combined build is recorded separately.

The changes retain strict host validation and all game HUDs. Android Auto still controls launcher eligibility: developer mode and Unknown sources alone do not admit Android for Cars App Library apps in real vehicles. Use a trusted Play testing channel; see [Google's testing requirements](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/testing). No real-road, wireless endurance, every-host, audible guidance or production navigation certification is claimed.

A subsequent combined debug/release JVM run passed **158 tests per variant**, with no failures, errors or skips. It includes three navigation hardening regressions: deleted local search matches are not retained in the provider cache, cancelling a shared-link lookup cancels its HTTP call, and redirect metadata is returned without automatically following an untrusted target. `clearHistory` also cancels pending searches, clears their visible state and replaces the memory cache; navigation notifications explicitly use private lock-screen visibility. Lint reports **zero errors** (91 debug / 85 release warnings) at this checkpoint. This source checkpoint includes the car-category overflow support but precedes the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. world addition.

The same checkpoint completed optimized `assembleRelease` and Preview instrumentation compilation successfully. Packaged debug/release manifest security checks passed. This APK is a development checkpoint; a later world/font change requires rebuilding before release.

The corrected adaptive setup test then passed on the expanded 37-world build, with explicit **1920 × 1080 phone landscape** and **2560 × 1600 tablet-sized landscape** captures and passing aspect-ratio assertions. Normal and 2× phone text checks passed in the same test. These captures were visually inspected: the settings action remains reachable, text wraps within the sheet, and the wide layout retains a centered sheet. `CarMenusTest` also passed both tests on the 37-world catalogue. These are individual passing cases from a combined invocation whose unrelated quest assertion failed; they are not reported as a fully passing combined invocation.

## 37-world, transport and voice checkpoint — 5 November 2026

The candidate now includes Exclusion Zone from issue #8, bringing the catalogue to **37 worlds**. Ten new map previews were rendered on the Samsung phone. Font provenance identifies the sourced families and conversions; all 47 raster assets in the shipping drawable/globe folders carry origin metadata.

- The combined debug/release build passes **167 unit tests per variant**, zero failures, errors or skips. Lint reports zero errors (93 debug / 87 release warnings). All three packaged-manifest checks (debug, Preview, release), 38 style files, version validation, repository hygiene and whitespace checks pass.
- The earlier combined physical-phone run passed **21 tests**: two installed speech-engine checks, adaptive settings, stationary world/vehicle switching, all 74 transport images, car sessions, host compatibility, menus, navigation synchronization and route journeys. Settings were exercised at normal/200% text, phone landscape and tablet-sized landscape; a labelled Game-style voice switch updates the stored preference. The owner confirmed both audible Old West and Sea Chart examples were clear.
- After the owner's screenshot exposed an incorrect left U-turn symbol on a right-turning route, all phone/car U-turn symbols now use the provider's turn bearings (with driving-side fallback for ambiguous bearings). The marker follows the current remaining road segment instead of a 12-metre chord across a tight bend. **Six fresh device tests pass** after these changes, including actual MapLibre marker/camera rotation and position checks through six public London route segments, stationary style switching and car compatibility.
- Every world now has nine original speech phrases: three starts, three travel cues and three arrivals. Unit checks cover rotation across all 37 worlds, preservation of turn text/timing/identity, standard-mode bypass, imminent-turn suppression and spacing. The later phrase expansion does not change the installed speech engine; only the Old West and Sea Chart samples were heard by the owner.
- The current unsigned optimized APK is **95,162,731 bytes**, approximately **8.7% larger** than signed 1.5.0 (87,551,880 bytes); final signing changes the exact size. The separately installable Preview build is 126,147,073 bytes. Private QA logs, screenshots and APKs remain ignored local artifacts.

These are functional and visual development checks, not adversarial security proof. The full security review is recorded separately. The earlier limitations still apply: no five-person novice study, older Android runtime, separate tablet hardware, physical-car road trial, real reboot, long battery endurance or signed in-place update result is claimed here.

The corrected DHU visual pass completed on the same phone at 1280 × 720. Full-map captures at 15, 45 and 70 metres of a public London route show the right U-turn before it, rotation through the bend and alignment after it. Split-view captures keep both the instruction and transport visible; Old West horse, Pixel minecart and Pixel motorcycle/pig switches were inspected. These are app-local simulated positions, with no global mock-location permission. Turn metadata follows the [OSRM StepManeuver contract](https://project-osrm.org/docs/v5.24.0/api/#stepmaneuver-object).

A further installed-engine run accepted four additional style samples (Pixel World, Dark Zone, Vector Command and Exclusion Zone), one passing opt-in test. Only the earlier two samples have explicit owner listening confirmation. The final design correction removes the redundant car readout brand label, retaining the world name and real speed in a shorter panel; the combined build still passes all 167 tests per variant and all three manifest checks.

## Android 2.0.0 — new community requests (5 November 2026)

The earlier 1.6.0 working candidate was folded into the **2.0.0** release; no 1.6.0 release was published by this work. Version code is **2000000**. The new scope adds Machine Atlas (NieR:Automata, #9), personal names for saved places (#10), dedicated bicycle routing (#11), default background release alerts and the motion/scroll refinements. The contributor-led iOS port (#12) remains separate.

- The first full 2.0 build passed **176 unit tests in both debug and release**, with zero failures, errors or skips. Debug/release lint reported **zero errors**, with 97/91 warnings. All **39 style files** (38 worlds plus the shared base), version consistency, repository hygiene and the debug/preview/release packaged component-boundary checks passed. Later source changes and their targeted checks are recorded below; this checkpoint is not a claim that later edits were in this build.
- The unsigned release APK at that checkpoint was **95,873,826 bytes**, compared with the published signed 1.5.0 APK at 87,551,880 bytes (about 9.5% larger). Signing can change the exact byte size. This is a local unsigned build, not a signed-update validation.
- The Samsung Android 17 phone passed a four-test run covering exact catalogue scroll restoration through preview, apply and activity recreation; saved-place renaming and bicycle-mode selection; default persisted update scheduling, battery-explanation dismissal and notification delivery; and a real MapLibre capture of Machine Atlas at public Tokyo Station coordinates. The catalogue's last-card top stayed **1079 px** before preview, after applying and after recreation (tolerance 4 px). The fix waits for actual window insets before first root measurement, with no timed restoration workaround.
- A separate permission-denial check passed: dismissing the notification explanation kept default background scheduling and the app usable. The delivery test used a simulated newer-release record, verified one notification per version and an explicit immutable action that opened update details without downloading. The Preview notification permission was restored to its original denied state after the test. This is not evidence that a future GitHub release has already notified a real user.
- A live public London bicycle fixture returned **5,625.407 m / 1,179.351 s / 23 steps** through Valhalla's bicycle profile and parsed into the native Ferrostar route. These are that request's results, not fixed estimates. Unit tests independently check the outgoing bicycle profile and Google Maps bicycling handoff.
- The 13-test navigation run passed the new feature journey, live cycling contract, all **114** world/Car/Motorcycle/Bicycle marker image checks, projected-map rendering and heading checks, car menus and host compatibility (**12 passing tests**). Its final AppMotion assertion used the old uppercase Saved heading; it was corrected to the current “Your places” label for a targeted rerun. The whole combined run is not reported as passing.
- The new native Machine Atlas preview and original globe texture bring the shipping drawable/globe provenance scan to **49 raster files, zero missing origins**. Map, glyph and completion-sound assets are bundled; no reference game screenshots are shipped.

The earlier physical-phone, timer, quest, motion and car checks above remain evidence at their stated snapshots. Physical phone reboot, older Android versions, real tablet hardware, a five-person novice usability study, real-road driving and a trusted real-car installation are not established by the 2.0 checks listed here. Simulation and resized-phone layouts are labelled as such. Final security disposition and signed-update results must be recorded separately when complete.

### Subsequent 2.0 fixes and checks

Saved-name review found two edge cases and they were corrected: each matching copy now changes only its own name, preserving that copy's other fields, and a completing search overlays current saved names instead of restoring an older label snapshot. The normal-phone feature journey passed with an explicit same-ID/different-coordinate selected-copy assertion.

The large-text run completed renaming but exposed a real route-preview overlap at 360dp/200% text: independently anchored panels covered the travel modes. The independent Impeccable review confirmed that defect and clipped action captions. The correction introduces a stable toolbar with one bounded scrollable route-details region for short windows/large text, plus flexible Save/More actions. It builds both Preview and optimized release, passes all 176 unit tests in each variant, and passes debug/release lint with zero errors (97/91 warnings); final phone recaptures and the reviewer's verdict are still pending. All three packaged-manifest checks, 39 map-style files, version validation, repository hygiene and whitespace checks pass at this correction. The Saved empty state now shares the page's scroller so its Find a place action can remain reachable with large text.

The corrected AppMotion heading assertion and map-following regression passed. A later five-test run ended with four passing tests and the main quest journey interrupted when the phone left Waypoint; that run is not an end-to-end quest pass. UI testing was stopped until the phone owner confirms availability. Test click helpers now check the app package and avoid capturing another app on failure.

The final security-review hardening removes an unused dependency-provided Compose PreviewActivity from the debug manifest. A new packaged-manifest gate rejects that component and unexpected exported activities in all variants. The debug APK rebuild and all three component gates pass; the optimized release and Preview already excluded it. This closes a declared debug entry point, not a claim that an adversarial runtime attack was reproduced.

The full standard codebase/read-only GitHub security audit completed all six phases before the first 2.0 push. Both validators pass: **zero confirmed findings, four needs-validation records and two rejected proposals**, across **167 coverage units** (124 covered, 19 candidate-linked and 24 blocked). All four retained records had a separate final independent review. The audit did not execute target code or perform phone attacks; its platform/native/hosted limits remain explicit in [security notes](security.md). This documentation summary was added after the frozen audit snapshot; application and workflow bytes remain the reviewed versions.

## Map-theme rebuild (6 November 2026)

- The dependency-free asset generator produced **76 map-material PNGs**, **76 per-world day/night POI atlases**, and **76 destination-marker PNGs** for all 38 worlds. `scripts/validate_map_assets.py` verified every expected filename and PNG dimension.
- The Waypoint style generator produced **78 authored styles**: day and night for all 38 worlds plus Dark Zone holographic day and night. The official MapLibre style validator reported **zero errors**. No preset style or sprite sheet was used.
- Android build, instrumentation tests, preview captures, and physical-phone QA were **not run in this pass**. The host has no JDK or Android SDK. The attached phone was not accessed because the requested `security-audit` skill's execution rules prohibit exposing ADB/device sockets; target-controlled execution is allowed only inside a sandbox with OS-enforced filesystem, network, environment, resource, and time limits. The offline containers used for asset generation and validation do not provide Android tooling or the device.
- Ferrostar guidance and route-provider code were left outside the edits; navigation, rerouting, and ETA behavior were not changed.

### Map-theme Android follow-up (6 November 2026)

- Waypoint debug Kotlin compilation, `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, and `:app:assembleDebug` completed successfully: **193 unit tests**, zero failures, errors, or skips. The asset validator checked 38 worlds, 76 map materials, 76 POI atlases, 76 destination markers, 78 authored styles, safe sprite padding, and per-category icon uniqueness. The style validator reported 78 styles and zero schema errors.
- After that build, **43 individual high-resolution POI icons** were generated and replaced in nine atlases from a manual crop review. A 43-icon contact sheet was visually checked; the asset and style validators passed again before the final APK and device run.
- The final repaired Preview APK then passed **all five** selected Samsung Android 17 instrumentation checks (318.94 seconds): theme switching across all 38 worlds with active sensor updates; a GPS-based route preview and active guidance while switching worlds; 130% text, landscape, route close, and map-information interactions; and three packaged security-boundary assertions. Gradle removed the isolated Preview app/test packages afterward. The production Waypoint installation stayed in place, and font scale and rotation settings were verified restored.

## Refactor and security follow-up (6 November 2026)

- The feature-folder refactor and updated README captures built in debug, Preview-test and optimized release variants. Both debug and release JVM suites passed **219 tests**, with zero failures, errors or skips. Both lint variants passed. Packaged debug and release manifest boundary checks passed.
- Asset validation passed for 38 worlds, 76 map materials, 76 POI atlases, 76 destination markers and 78 authored styles; the style schema check reported zero errors. Repository hygiene, version consistency, workflow syntax and staged whitespace checks passed. The README image capture test passed earlier on the isolated Preview installation with a fixed public London road position.
- After the security follow-up, the Car App Library 1.9.0-alpha03 dependency compiled in the debug app, instrumentation APK and optimized release. The new bounded WAV tests passed in both JVM variants. The CI summary matrix was checked for passing main and PR jobs and for failure when a required job is skipped.
- The optional motion toolchain then received a patched `minimatch` override. A clean `npm ci`, ESLint/TypeScript lint and moderate-threshold `npm audit` passed with zero advisories.
- The full connected Preview suite was attempted after restructuring and stopped before any test ran: ADB reported no connected devices, and the local SDK has no emulator installation. A later [GitHub `dev` run](https://github.com/the-geeky-couldron/waypoint/actions/runs/42257778440) passed 15 emulator checks covering packaged security, quest storage and car sessions. The new Car library's host compatibility and the two remaining AndroidX parser/lifecycle concerns still need isolated device validation before a production release. Android builds now run only after a push to `main`; pull requests targeting `main` run source and dependency checks, and a `dev` push deploys the site without building the app.

### Android Auto route choices and refreshed captures (November 2026)

- The car preview now draws other routes as quieter lines with their time difference, frames every route on offer, and adds a **Routes** list. During guidance an icon action opens **Other routes**, which lists fresh alternatives and switches guidance through the same controller call as the phone map. New unit tests (`CarRouteAlternatesTest`) cover which routes are shown, their labels and the preview framing; the full debug unit suite passes. The in-drive **Other routes** list was not exercised on the Desktop Head Unit, because no alternative appeared on the short public test route; treat it as unit-tested only.
- New phone captures were taken on the connected Samsung with `ReadmeScreenshotsTest` in the light map theme, using the isolated Preview package and fixed public London positions (Trafalgar Square, and Spaniards Road on Hampstead Heath for the Old West hero).
- New Android Auto captures were taken with the Desktop Head Unit 2.0 over the developer head-unit server, in a single-pane 1280 × 720 layout in day mode. `CarReadmeCaptureTest` ignored the phone's real GPS, fed its own fixes along a public Hampstead Heath route through the real route, Start and guidance flow, and pinned the light map theme. The first attempts followed the phone's real position, so those images were discarded and never published.

## Map icons and HUD restoration (7 November 2026)

- All 38 day/night POI atlas pairs were reviewed in [seven contact sheets](poi-atlas-audit.md). The 36 ImageGen worlds now use checked-in crop bounds and 92 tracked cell overrides. Home Console went from 29 detected horizontal splits and 32 detached fragments to zero. A clean Pillow 13.0.0 environment reproduced all 72 ImageGen day/night PNGs byte for byte. Asset validation, four crop regression tests, repair parity, the Night City source-hash generator check, and style-generator parity for Machine Atlas and Night City passed. The MapLibre validator checked 78 styles with zero errors; repository hygiene and workflow syntax passed.
- Debug and Preview APKs built. The debug suite passed **240 unit tests** with zero failures or errors; Android lint reported **zero errors** and 105 warnings. On the connected Samsung Android 17 phone, four targeted instrumentation tests passed for HUD preference persistence and world-aware player markers. Two more instrumentation runs captured refreshed Machine Atlas and Night City world cards through the isolated Preview package. The production app was not replaced.
- Phone screenshots were checked in portrait and landscape with Standard/Original and Large/Left controls, plus 150% and 200% system text. Machine Atlas uses the shared aligned control layout in both orientations. A longer world title visibly scrolled in the top-left selector. Double-tap zoom changed the projected scale bar from **100 m** to **50 m**. The temporary rotation and font-scale settings were restored. The connected phone did not provide an Android Auto display for a new visual capture in this pass; the shared Night City marker selection passed its device test and the car code compiled.

## 2.5.4 landscape and release gate (7 November 2026)

- The final local gate assembled debug, isolated Preview, Preview instrumentation, and optimized unsigned release APKs. Debug and release suites each passed **240 unit tests** with zero failures, errors, or skips. Android lint reported **zero errors** (105 debug and 99 release warnings). The release APK was **118.28 MiB**, below the 150 MiB limit for older installed updaters. Packaged manifest checks passed for all three APK variants.
- The Pillow 13.0.0 asset validator checked 38 worlds, 76 materials, 76 day/night POI atlases, 76 destination markers, 92 tracked repairs, and 78 authored styles. Its four crop-regression tests passed. The style schema validator reported **78 styles and zero errors**; release-version, repository-hygiene, and whitespace checks passed.
- On the connected Samsung Android 17 phone, the isolated Preview package passed `AtlasSmokeTest` across **all 38 worlds** and their map keys, followed by landscape captures and 48 dp, nonoverlapping Tilt/Locate checks in Machine Atlas, Night City, and Home Console (`OK (1 test)`, 416.872 seconds). The final `NavigationUiTest` then passed a real GPS route, world switching in preview and guidance, landscape route/guidance checks at **130% and 200%** text, and a narrowed **484 dp landscape** guidance viewport at 200% text (`OK (1 test)`, 69.463 seconds). Back, Settings, modes, Locate, Start, Worlds, Steps, Mute, and End stayed reachable; the route persisted across world changes.
- The landscape captures were reviewed locally. The side preview leaves map space at 200% text. The guidance marker stays clear of the trip strip, and the narrow layout shows a short turn label, time and distance on separate lines, and two rows of 48 dp actions. Captures contain the phone's local geography and remain outside Git. The existing production Waypoint package and its data were not replaced.

This is stationary phone and source validation. There was no physical road drive, separate tablet hardware, real-car Android Auto capture, older Android runtime check, or signed in-place update in this pass.
