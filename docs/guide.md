# Waypoint

Native Android navigation with game-inspired maps. Kotlin + Jetpack Compose +
MapLibre Native. **Twenty-seven game-inspired map styles, no ads, accounts, purchases or feature
locks.** Source code is MIT licensed.

This is an independent implementation inspired by the supplied screenshots and
visible controls in Game Maps IRL. It does not contain that app's code or assets,
and does not modify the installed app.
Visual references and implementation decisions are recorded in [the sourcebook](visual-sourcebook.md). It is not affiliated with game publishers.

## Use

Install `dist/Waypoint.apk` on Android 8.0 or newer, or build the debug APK below.
Open Waypoint, choose a world on the welcome screen, then tap **Open map**. Tap **Locate**, and allow **precise location**. Search for
a destination or hold the map to drop a pin. Choose Car, Motorcycle or Walk. Once a route is ready, tap
**Start navigation**. The app provides live position, next turns, ETA, remaining
distance, speed, spoken instructions, off-route recalculation, and arrival.

- **Worlds:** 27 game-inspired styles, searchable by game name. All included.
- **Saved:** bookmark a destination; navigate to it again later.
- **Settings:** voice, metric/imperial, 2D/3D, updates, permissions,
  and clearing saved places/history.
- Dragging the map pauses camera following. Tap the location button to recenter.
- Navigation continues through a location foreground service when the screen is
  off. Stop it in the app or from its ongoing Android notification.
- Standard `geo:` and `google.navigation:` destination links are supported.

## Android Auto (disabled)

The experimental projected integration is disabled and not exported in 0.2.1. Its
Binder caller identity and protocol-state handling need isolated cross-UID validation
before this component can be enabled. The source remains available for that work.
There is no user setting to bypass this restriction. Phone navigation continues to
support Car, Motorcycle and Walk. See [the security review](security.md).

## Build

Requires JDK 17, Android SDK Platform 35 and Build Tools 35.0.0. Open the project
in Android Studio or point `local.properties` to your SDK:

```properties
sdk.dir=/absolute/path/to/android-sdk
```

```sh
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The supplied `dist/Waypoint.apk` is the optimized GitHub release build. Rebuild it with
`./gradlew :app:assembleRelease`. Connected UI tests can target that build with
`./gradlew -PtestBuildType=release :app:connectedReleaseAndroidTest` on an unlocked
development phone; the navigation flow expects a saved nearby destination.

The Gradle wrapper is included. API keys are not required. Local builds use your Android debug key. GitHub releases use the stable signing identity
from encrypted repository secrets; see [Releasing](releasing.md).
No private signing material is included in the source.

## Services and limits

- Map tiles/glyphs/sprites: [OpenFreeMap](https://openfreemap.org/), derived from
  [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright).
- Search and reverse geocoding: [Photon public demo](https://github.com/komoot/photon).
- Driving routes and steps: [OSRM public demo](https://project-osrm.org/).
- Voice: Android's installed text-to-speech engine.

The public endpoints are suitable for evaluation and can be throttled or unavailable.
For a public release, self-host or contract services with suitable capacity and
availability; the endpoints are isolated in `MapRepository.kt` and the style JSON.
Routes do not include live traffic, closures, speed-limit enforcement,
lane guidance, or offline routing. GPS accuracy and map coverage vary. ETA is
estimated from route progress. Road testing is still required. The app is a working
prototype, not a claim of complete feature parity or production navigation quality.

## Sensor-assisted navigation

High-accuracy fused location is preferred, with native Android GPS/network fallback.
The phone’s rotation vector provides compass heading at rest; usable GPS course takes
over in motion. Sensor calibration, accuracy and satellite status appear in Settings.
See [sensor behavior and limits](sensors.md).

## Location and privacy

Location permission is requested when you tap the GPS control. Precise location is
needed for navigation. Foreground GPS stops when the app is not visible unless
navigation is active; the navigation service is visible in Android notifications.
No background-location permission, account, analytics or app-owned server exists.
The optional fused-location dependency uses Google Play services and its device
location settings. Native GNSS/network fallback supports devices without it.

Map providers receive the tiles requested. Photon receives search terms and location
bias; OSRM or Valhalla receives route origin/destination coordinates and the selected routing profile. Saved/recent places and
settings remain in device preferences, excluded from cloud backup/device transfer.
You can clear those places in Settings. Location history is not recorded.

## Architecture

- `MainActivity.kt`: native Material 3 screens, permissions and preferences.
- `GameAtlasHud.kt`, `FantasyAtlases.kt`, `ModernAtlases.kt`: 27 distinct native atlas compositions.
- `GameHud.kt`: panel shapes, typography, library and shared route guidance.
- `Cartography.kt`: per-world camera rules, player pointers and original POI icons.
- `HeadingSensor.kt`: sensor projection, display remapping and true-north correction.
- `HeadingArbiter.kt`: confidence, freshness, hysteresis and compass/course selection.
- `WorldMap.kt`: MapLibre lifecycle, themed vector map, markers and camera following.
- `NavigationController.kt`: GPS, async search/routing, persisted places, voice and state.
- `NavigationEngine.kt`: pure route projection, maneuver progress and arrival logic.
- `NavigationService.kt`: visible foreground service and background guidance lifecycle.
- `WaypointCarService.kt`: projected Android Auto screens and themed map surface.
- `MapRepository.kt`: HTTPS search, reverse geocoding and OSRM routing.
- `assets/styles/`: generated vector styles, with per-world road hierarchy, building treatment and relief.
- `scripts/cartography_profiles.py`: explicit road, casing, label and building rules.

Tests cover heading wraparound/smoothing, segment projection, route-distance maneuver sequencing, GPS jitter,
off-route fixes, route crossings, destination loops, arrival, units and instructions.
See `docs/validation.md` for actual verification and outstanding hardware checks.
See `docs/reference-observations.md` for the bounded reference inspection.

## Licenses

Waypoint code: MIT (`LICENSE`). Google Play services location: Google SDK terms
(the library is a dependency; it is not relicensed as MIT). MapLibre: BSD-2-Clause. OpenStreetMap data: ODbL.
OpenFreeMap Liberty derives from OSM Liberty (BSD-3-Clause) and OpenMapTiles
(CC-BY 4.0 style/schema attribution). Barlow Condensed, Rye and VT323 fonts: SIL OFL,
Cinzel, Monocraft, Rajdhani, Share Tech Mono, Roboto Condensed, Libre Baskerville, Noto Sans and Orbitron are SIL OFL; Yellowtail is Apache-2.0,
with license files in `docs/licenses`. Theme names identify inspiration; no game
art, logos, textures, voices, or proprietary fonts are included.

## Transport modes

Choose **Car**, **Motorcycle**, or **Walk** in search or route preview. Switching mode
recalculates the route and ETA before starting. Car uses OSRM; motorcycle and walking
use the FOSSGIS Valhalla public server with dedicated `motorcycle` and `pedestrian`
costing profiles and GeoJSON/OSRM output. There is no silent car-route substitution.
The mode is saved for the next launch. `TravelMode.kt` is the extension point for
additional supported transport profiles. Valhalla requests are spaced by at least
1.1 seconds and use an identifying client header; use remains subject to the public server’s capacity and usage policy.

## Expanded library

27 themes: Los Santos, Old West, Night City, Pixel World, Green Terminal, San Andreas,
Midnight Run, The Continent, Vice Coast, Liberty City, Nudle Maps, Sheikah Slate,
Skyrim, Lands Between, Horizon, Animus, Hope County, Tsushima, Bridges, The Embrace,
Manhattan, Highlands, Surface Map, Bohemia, Steelport, Medici and Lost Heaven. Search the Worlds library by game name.
Fantasy/terrain themes use Mapzen Terrain Tiles for actual geographic relief,
with [provider credits](https://github.com/tilezen/joerd/blob/master/docs/attribution.md).
These recreate map/HUD design language; they are not pixel-perfect game asset ports.

## Regenerating and validating map assets

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_styles.py
npm ci --prefix tools/style-validation
node scripts/validate_styles.cjs
node scripts/generate_glyphs.cjs
# Optional: regenerate original textures/sprites (requires Pillow)
python3 scripts/generate_materials.py
```

Road camera expressions must stay top-level in MapLibre. The generator scales their
output stops; wrapping the entire zoom expression in arithmetic makes native roads
disappear. A theme load also has a monotonic generation so its camera and sources
are reapplied, while pointer animation is cancelled before its native layers are replaced.

The reference screenshots are research evidence only and are excluded from both the
APK and source archive. Original runtime textures, fonts with licenses, authored map
symbols and generated styles are included. No generated binary is needed to build from source.

The Worlds library is reachable from every atlas, route preview and active navigation. Changing worlds preserves the current destination, transport and route. Native road labels use bundled glyphs; see `docs/map-fonts.md` for font provenance and fidelity limits. The small map-info control opens provider credits without a long footer over the map.

## Interface performance

The welcome screen uses a short native reveal and a world-preview crossfade. Lists use stable item keys and cached, batched map thumbnail paths. MapLibre rendering, pointer animations and native camera/source work pause while search, the world library, settings or route details cover the map. Navigation tracking continues independently. The system animation scale is honored by Compose and Android animators.
